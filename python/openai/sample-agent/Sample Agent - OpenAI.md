# Sample Agent - Python AgentFramework

This directory contains a sample agent implementation using Python and Open AI SDK.

## Demonstrates

This sample shows how to build an agent using Open AI in Python with the Microsoft Agent 365 SDK. It covers:

Observability: End-to-end tracing, caching, and monitoring for agent applications
Notifications: Services and models for managing user notifications
Tooling: Developer tools for building advanced agent solutions
Hosting Patterns: Hosting with Microsoft 365 Agents SDK

## Prerequisites & End-to-End Testing
To run the agent, follow the step-by-step instructions in this guide: [Configure Agent Testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-agent-365/developer/testing?tabs=python)
