# Devin Sample Agent - Node.js

This sample demonstrates how to build an agent using Devin in Node.js with the Microsoft Agent 365 SDK. It covers:

- **Observability**: End-to-end tracing, caching, and monitoring for agent applications
- **Notifications**: Services and models for managing user notifications
- **Tools**: Model Context Protocol tools for building advanced agent solutions
- **Hosting Patterns**: Hosting with Microsoft 365 Agents SDK

This sample uses the [Microsoft Agent 365 SDK for Node.js](https://github.com/microsoft/Agent365-nodejs).
