# Contributor Points Configuration
#
# All keyword matching is CASE-INSENSITIVE. Contributors can use any capitalization.
# For example: "detailed", "Detailed", "DETAILED" all work the same way.
#
# Scoring Rules:
# 1. Review types are mutually exclusive (only highest value applies)
#    - "detailed" keyword awards detailed_review points
#    - "basic review" keyword awards basic_review points (only if "detailed" not present)
# 2. Bonuses are additive and can stack with review types:
#    - "performance" keyword adds performance_improvement bonus
#    - Approved PR (state=approved) adds approve_pr bonus
# 3. Contribution types are awarded based on GitHub events:
#    - PR merged awards pr_merged points
#    - Issue closed awards issue_resolved points
#    - Documentation changes award documentation points
#    - Security fixes award security_fix points
#
# Examples (all case-insensitive):
#   - "basic review" OR "Basic Review" OR "BASIC REVIEW" = 5 points
#   - "detailed analysis" OR "Detailed Analysis" = 10 points
#   - "detailed performance review" OR "DETAILED PERFORMANCE REVIEW" = 10 + 4 = 14 points
#   - Approved PR with "basic review" = 5 + 3 = 8 points
#   - Approved PR with "detailed performance review" = 10 + 4 + 3 = 17 points
#   - PR merged = 5 points
#   - Issue closed = 1 point
#   - Documentation update = 3 points
#   - Security fix = 8 points
