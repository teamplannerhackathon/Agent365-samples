# Contributor Points Configuration
#
# Scoring is based on actual review actions, not keywords.
# All contributions are valued and tracked automatically.
#
# Scoring Rules:
# 1. Any PR review submission = review_submission points (base points)
# 2. Substantial review (100+ characters, excluding whitespace) = detailed_review bonus (additive)
# 3. PR approval (state=approved) = approve_pr bonus (additive)
# 4. PR comment (not a full review) = pr_comment points
#
# Examples:
#   - Simple review with short comment = 5 points
#   - Review with detailed comment (100+ characters) = 5 + 5 = 10 points
#   - Approved PR = 5 + 3 = 8 points
#   - Approved PR with detailed feedback = 5 + 5 + 3 = 13 points
#   - Comment on PR (not a review) = 2 points
