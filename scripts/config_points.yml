# Contributor Points Configuration
#
# This configuration defines point values for various contribution activities.
# Points are calculated automatically by the workflow and displayed in PR comments.
#
# Scoring Rules:
# 1. Review submission = base points
# 2. Detailed review (100+ characters) = bonus points (additive)
# 3. PR approval = bonus points (additive)
# 4. PR merged = points for author
# 5. Special labels (bug, priority, docs) = bonus points
# 6. First-time contributor = bonus points
#
# Examples:
#   - Simple review with short comment = 5 points
#   - Review with detailed comment (100+ chars) = 10 points (5 + 5)
#   - Approved PR with detailed feedback = 13 points (5 + 5 + 3)
#   - PR merged with bug fix = 10 points (5 + 5)
