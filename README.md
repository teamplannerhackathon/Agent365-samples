# Microsoft Agent 365 SDK Samples and Prompts

This repository contains sample agents and prompts for building with the Microsoft Agent 365 SDK. The Microsoft Agent 365 SDK extends the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK with enterprise-grade capabilities for building sophisticated agents. It provides comprehensive tooling for observability, notifications, runtime utilities, and development tools that help developers create production-ready agents for platforms including M365, Teams, Copilot Studio, and Webchat.

- **Sample agents** are available in C# (.NET), Python, and Node.js/TypeScript
- **Prompts** to help you get started with AI-powered development tools like Cursor IDE
